## Key Insights

### "Lose Focus" Problem

**Issue**: Adding framework files alongside existing guidelines marginalizes original docs.

**Discovery**: First nexus integration added 4 files. Result: .claude/CLAUDE.md (with PR rules) lost its central role.

**Solution**: Merge framework INTO CLAUDE.md (+16 lines), delete new files. Keep single AI entry point.

### File Naming & Recall

CLAUDE.md naming helps AI discover file, but doesn't guarantee recall at execution time. Need workflow rules + practice.

### Skills Architecture

Skills complement guidelines, don't replace them:
```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              ← Primary (all AIs)
└── skills/onboarding/     ← Enhancement (Claude Code only)
```

---

## Philosophy Shift

**From**: Template copying (create parallel docs structure)
**To**: AI-driven integration (merge into existing docs)

**Principle**: Destination repo's guidelines remain central. Framework adds missing pieces only.
