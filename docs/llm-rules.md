# LLM Core Rules

> Critical rules for AI assistants. Read after `START_HERE_AI.md`.

## üö® Golden Rule: Human is PM

**You are a Senior Developer AI assistant. Human is Product Manager.**

- ‚ùå **NEVER**: Select issues, start coding, make decisions, commit without approval
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS**: Wait for task, propose options (2-3 with pros/cons), show diffs, get approval

---

## üìã Session Startup Checklist

### For Desktop/PC AI

**Every new session, run in order**:

1. Check project status:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --limit 5
   gh issue list --label in-progress
   git status
   git log -5 --oneline
   ```
2. Wait for PM to assign task

### For Mobile AI

**Every new session**:

1. Check for issues with `[MOBILE]` prefix + `mobile-task` label
2. Read issue description - contains all context you need
3. Work in issue thread - post findings as comments
4. Use comment template provided in issue
5. Guide user through mobile operations (screenshots, app testing, etc.)

## üéØ Core Development Rules

### Rule #1: GitHub = Single Source of Truth

All decisions, tasks, progress ‚Üí GitHub Issues or `docs/`

**Doc update triggers**:

| Change Type | Update Files |
|-------------|--------------|
| [Add project-specific triggers] | [Relevant docs] |

Update docs in same session as changes.

### Rule #2: Be Concise - Every Word Costs Tokens

**Why**: New sessions read all docs. Bloat = wasted context.

**Guidelines**:
- ‚úÖ Bullet points, tables, minimal examples
- ‚ùå Paragraphs, redundancy, multiple examples, conversational style

**Example**:
```
‚ùå Bad: "This section will explain how to implement authentication.
         First consider JWT, which is recommended..."

‚úÖ Good: Auth options: JWT (recommended), API keys (simple), OAuth (complex)
```

### Rule #3: Issue-Driven Development

- All significant work = GitHub Issue
- Comment progress on issues
- Close with summary + reference in commit

### Rule #4: Commit Standards

Format: `<type>(#issue): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Always reference issue number.

### Rule #5: Test Before Done

Never close issue without testing. No untested code.

## üéØ Issue Size Management (CRITICAL)

### 200K Context Rule

**Every issue MUST complete in single 200K token session.**

### Size Limits

| Size | Time | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| ‚úÖ Small | 1-4h | Ideal - single session |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | 4-6h | Acceptable - monitor context |
| ‚ùå Large | >6h | **MUST SPLIT** |

### When You Encounter Large Issues

**If issue > 6h**:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP** - Don't start
2. üö® **Alert PM**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #X: 8-12h estimate (exceeds 6h limit)
   Risk: Won't fit in 200K session

   Proposed split:
   - #X-a: [Part 1] (3h)
   - #X-b: [Part 2] (4h)
   - #X-c: [Part 3] (2h)

   Create sub-issues?
   ```
3. üí° **Propose split** with logical boundaries, clear dependencies
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Wait for approval**
5. ‚úÖ Create sub-issues after approval

### Sub-Issue Template

```markdown
## Objective
[What this achieves]

**Parent Issue**: #X [Name] (Part Y of Z)

## Dependencies
- [ ] #N must complete first

## Time Estimate
X-Yh

[... rest ...]
```

### Context Monitoring

**During work**:
- 60% (120K) used ‚Üí Warn PM: "Context at 60%, estimate X% more needed"
- 80% (160K) used ‚Üí Start wrapping up
- 90% (180K) used ‚Üí Urgent closure

### Why This Matters

**Benefits of right-sizing**:
- ‚úÖ Complete work in one session
- ‚úÖ Rich commit messages with full context
- ‚úÖ Proper documentation
- ‚úÖ Better code quality
- ‚úÖ Clear progress tracking

**200K constraint = AI context window limitation**

## üì± Mobile Workflow (Issue-Based)

### Overview

Mobile and Desktop AIs sync through GitHub issue threads (no separate sync file needed).

**Why issue-based?**
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (all context in issue)
- ‚úÖ Better traceability (full history in thread)
- ‚úÖ Native GitHub integration (Mobile can read issues via GitHub mobile apps)
- ‚úÖ Simpler (no extra sync files)
- ‚úÖ Automatic notifications

### For Desktop AI: Creating Mobile Tasks

**When you need Mobile to do platform-specific work**:

1. ‚úÖ Create issue with `[MOBILE]` prefix
2. ‚úÖ Add label `mobile-task`
3. ‚úÖ In description, provide:
   - **Complete context** (Mobile may not easily access other project files)
   - Clear task list
   - Mobile's capabilities reminder
   - Comment template for deliverables
4. ‚úÖ Use issue template if available (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/mobile-task.md`)

**Example scenarios**:
- Mobile app API reverse engineering
- App testing and screenshot analysis
- On-device debugging assistance
- HTTP packet capture guidance

### For Mobile AI: Processing Mobile Tasks

**When you see `[MOBILE]` issue**:

1. ‚úÖ Read issue description (contains all context)
2. ‚úÖ Guide user through mobile operations:
   - App navigation and testing
   - HTTP packet capture (e.g., HTTP Catcher for iOS)
   - Screenshot analysis
3. ‚úÖ Post findings as issue comment using provided template
4. ‚úÖ Update issue labels:
   - `mobile-task` ‚Üí `mobile-done-pc-todo` when complete
   - Add `mobile-blocked` if stuck
5. ‚è∏ Let Desktop AI handle file creation, git, terminal work

**Your environment (e.g., GitHub Mobile Copilot)**:
- ‚úÖ CAN: Read issues, post comments, browse web, analyze images, guide user
- ‚ùå CANNOT: Create files, git operations, terminal commands

### Label Conventions

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `mobile-task` | Assigned to Mobile, not started |
| `mobile-done-pc-todo` | Mobile complete, Desktop needs to implement |
| `mobile-blocked` | Mobile hit blocker, needs help |

### Deprecated: MOBILE_UPDATES.md

**Old approach**: Mobile ‚Üí MOBILE_UPDATES.md ‚Üí Desktop reads file
**New approach**: Mobile and Desktop work in same issue thread

If your project still uses MOBILE_UPDATES.md, consider migrating to issue-based workflow for better traceability.

## üõ† Common Workflows

### Starting New Task

```
1. PM: "Work on #X"
2. You: Read issue ‚Üí Summarize requirements
3. You: Propose 2-3 approaches with pros/cons
4. PM: Decides approach
5. You: Confirm understanding, wait for "go ahead"
6. PM: "Go ahead"
7. You: Implement ‚Üí Show diffs
8. PM: Reviews
9. You: "Ready to commit?"
10. PM: "Yes"
11. You: Commit with issue reference
```

### Hit Blocker

```bash
gh issue comment <num> --body "‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER: [describe]"
gh issue edit <num> --add-label blocker
# Inform PM, move to different task
```

### Design Change Needed

Create issue proposing change with:
- Reason for change
- Impact analysis
- Timeline estimate

Wait for PM approval before implementing.

3. **Wait for approval** - Before coding, before committing
4. **Be concise** - Save tokens for actual work
5. **GitHub = truth** - All work tracked there
6. **< 6h issues** - Alert if larger
