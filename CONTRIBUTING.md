## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

### For Documentation

- **Be concise**: Remember, every word costs tokens
- **Use bullets**: Over paragraphs
- **Use tables**: For comparisons
- **One example max**: Per concept
- **Keep placeholders**: Like `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[AI_TOOL_1]`

#### Avoid "Lose Focus" Problem

**Problem**: Too much content ‚Üí AI loses focus on what's important

**When writing/updating docs**:
1. Ask PM: "What's the target length? What must be included?"
2. Prioritize core content (95% use cases)
3. Compress edge cases (5% use cases) to minimal form
4. Use tables/bullets instead of paragraphs
5. Remove examples unless critical

**Bottom line**: Before writing, check with PM about length/focus concerns.

#### Code in Documentation

**Rule**: When writing docs, minimize code examples. Only use code when genuinely clearer than prose.

**Applies to**: Claude (tends to overuse code blocks in descriptions).

### For Templates

- **Maintain structure**: Don't break the tiered approach (üî¥üü°üü¢‚ö™)
- **Test thoroughly**: With at least 2 different LLMs
- **Preserve universality**: Don't add tool-specific code
- **Update SETUP_GUIDE.md**: If adding new placeholders

### For Code/Scripts

- **Keep it simple**: This is a template, not production code
- **Add comments**: Explain what it does
- **Make it universal**: Should work on Windows/Mac/Linux

---

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

1. **Placeholder test**:
   - All placeholders still marked clearly
   - SETUP_GUIDE.md documents all placeholders

2. **LLM test**:
   - Feed START_HERE_AI.md to an LLM
   - Verify it understands in < 5 minutes
   - Test with different LLMs if possible

3. **Markdown test**:
   - Preview in GitHub-style markdown renderer
   - Check all links work
   - Verify formatting is correct

4. **Setup test**:
   - Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md in a test project
   - Verify all steps work
   - Check for missing instructions

## üé® Style Guide

### Writing Style

**Good**:
```markdown

1. Copy files
2. Replace placeholders
3. Tell AI: "Read START_HERE_AI.md"
```

**Bad**:
```markdown
## Getting Started

In this section, we will walk through the process of getting started
with the framework. First, you'll need to copy all the necessary files
to your project directory. After that, you should replace all the
placeholder values...
```
