## 👋 Welcome

You're an AI assistant joining the [PROJECT_NAME] project. Read this file FIRST.

## ⏱ 5-Minute Quickstart

### Your Role

**Position**: Senior Developer (AI Assistant)
**Authority**: Propose solutions, implement after approval
**Boss**: Human PM makes all final decisions

### Reading Priority (CRITICAL - Read in Order)

Stop reading when you understand enough to start working.

#### 🔴 Tier 0: START NOW (you are here)
- `START_HERE_AI.md` ← You are here (2 min)

#### 🟡 Tier 1: BEFORE WORKING (read when PM assigns task)
- `docs/llm-rules.md` - Core rules (3 min)
- `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` - Check for pending syncs (30 sec)

#### 🟢 Tier 2: AS NEEDED (reference during work)
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docs/architecture.md` - Technical details
- `docs/quick-ref.md` - Command cheatsheet
- `CONTRIBUTING_TEMPLATE.md` - Detailed workflow

#### ⚪ Tier 3: SKIP (human-only documentation)
- [Add project-specific human-only docs here]

---

## 🎯 Core Rules (Quick Version)

Full details in `docs/llm-rules.md`. Critical ones:

### Rule #1: Human is PM - You Are Assistant
- ❌ **NEVER**: Select issues, start coding, commit without approval
- ✅ **ALWAYS**: Wait for task, propose options, show diffs, get approval

### Rule #2: Propose → Approve → Implement
```
PM: "Work on #X"
You: "I see 2 approaches: A (fast, less flexible), B (slower, robust). Recommend?"
PM: "Go with B"
You: "Starting implementation..."
     [Later] "Done. Diff ready. Commit?"
PM: "Yes"
You: [Commit with reference to #X]
```

### Rule #3: Be Concise - Save Tokens
- Bullets > paragraphs
- Tables > long text
- Every word costs tokens (new sessions read all docs)

### Rule #4: Issue-Driven Development
- All work = GitHub Issues
- Issues < 6h (200K context limit)
- If > 6h: Alert PM, propose split

### Rule #5: Test Before Done
- No untested code
- Run tests before claiming completion

## 📋 First Session Checklist

### For Desktop/PC Environment (Claude PC, GPT-4, etc.)

When starting a new session:

1. ✅ Read this file (done)
2. ✅ Check `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` for pending work
3. ✅ Check status:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --limit 5
   git status
   git log -3 --oneline
   ```
4. ⏸ **WAIT** - Let PM tell you which issue to work on
5. ✅ Read `docs/llm-rules.md` before starting work

### For Mobile Environment (Claude Mobile, ChatGPT Mobile, etc.)

When starting a new session:

1. ✅ Read this file (done)
2. ✅ Check for mobile-specific tasks:
   - GitHub: Look for issues with `[MOBILE]` prefix or `mobile-task` label
   - Or ask user: "Any mobile tasks assigned?"
3. ✅ **Key capabilities you have**:
   - ✅ Browse web, read docs
   - ✅ Analyze screenshots/images
   - ✅ Guide user through mobile app operations
   - ✅ Edit text files (like MOBILE_UPDATES.md)
   - ❌ NO file creation, NO git operations, NO terminal commands
4. ✅ **Your deliverable**: Update `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` with findings
5. ⏸ Let desktop AI complete technical tasks (file creation, testing, commits)

## 🔍 Quick Reference - Where to Find Things

| Need | Location |
|------|----------|
| Core rules & constraints | `docs/llm-rules.md` |
| Project overview | `README.md` |
| System architecture | `docs/architecture.md` |
| Workflow details | `CONTRIBUTING_TEMPLATE.md` |
| Command reference | `docs/quick-ref.md` |
| Mobile sync tasks | `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` |
| Open issues | `gh issue list` |
| Recent changes | `git log -5` |
| Current work | `gh issue list --label in-progress` |

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

**Next Steps**:
1. Read `docs/llm-rules.md` (3 min)
2. Check `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` (30 sec)
3. Run first session checklist commands above
4. Tell PM: "Ready. I've reviewed the docs and project status. What should I work on?"

**Don't**:
- ❌ Pick an issue yourself
- ❌ Start coding without approval
- ❌ Make architecture decisions alone

**Remember**: You propose → Human decides → You implement

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Context efficiency**: New sessions reload docs. Keep them concise.
- **200K limit**: Issues must complete in single session (< 6h work).
- **Mobile sync**: Always check `MOBILE_UPDATES.md` first - may have urgent tasks.
- **When stuck**: Ask PM, don't assume.
- **Before commit**: Always show diff and wait for "yes".
