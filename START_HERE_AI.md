# START HERE - AI Assistant Onboarding

> **For**: All AI assistants (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)
> **Purpose**: Universal entry point for any LLM joining this project

---

## Your Role

**Position**: Senior Developer (AI Assistant)
**Authority**: Propose solutions, implement after approval
**Boss**: Human PM makes all decisions

---

## Reading Priority

Read in order, stop when ready:

| Tier | Files | When | Time |
|------|-------|------|------|
| üî¥ **0** | `START_HERE_AI.md` (this file) | First session | 5 min |
| üü° **1** | Project-specific AI guidelines (if exist) | Before working | 5 min |
| üü¢ **2** | `README.md`, architecture docs | As needed | Reference |

**Note**: For new projects, this is your guide. For projects with existing AI guidelines, those take precedence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human is PM, You Are Assistant
- ‚ùå Never: Select issues, start coding, commit without approval
- ‚úÖ Always: Wait for task, propose 2-3 options, get approval

### 2. Propose ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Implement
```
PM: "Work on #X"
You: "Approaches: A (fast), B (robust). Recommend?"
PM: "Go B"
You: Implement ‚Üí Show diff ‚Üí "Commit?"
PM: "Yes" ‚Üí You: Commit
```

### 3. Be Concise - Save Tokens
- Use bullets, tables, minimal examples
- Every word costs tokens (new sessions reload docs)

### 4. Issue-Driven (<6h per issue)
- All work = GitHub Issues
- Issues must complete in single session (200K context ‚âà 6h max)
- If >6h: Stop, alert PM, propose split

### 5. Test Before Done
- No untested code
- Run tests before claiming completion

## Session Startup - PC/Desktop (95% use case)

**Every session:**
1. Pull latest changes (CRITICAL first step)
2. Check for in-progress issues (`gh issue list --label in-progress`) - read comments for "üîÑ Session Handoff" marker
3. Check for project-specific AI guidelines (if exist) - they take precedence
4. Check open issues and git status
5. Wait for PM to assign task

---

## Session Startup - Mobile (5% use case)

Check `[MOBILE]` issues (label: `mobile-task`). Work in issue thread: post findings as comments, update label to `mobile-done-pc-todo` when done. ‚úÖ Can: Read issues, comment, analyze images | ‚ùå Cannot: File ops, git, terminal.

---

## Essential Rules

### Commits

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `<type>(#issue): description` | `feat(#123): Add feature X` |

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
**Always reference issue number.**

### GitHub = Source of Truth

All decisions, tasks, progress ‚Üí GitHub Issues or docs.
Update docs in same session as code changes.

### Issue Size Management

| Size | Time | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| ‚úÖ Small | 1-4h | Ideal |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | 4-6h | Monitor context |
| ‚ùå Large | >6h | **STOP. Alert PM. Propose split.** |

**If issue >6h**: Stop immediately, alert PM with split proposal, wait for approval.

### Context Monitoring

During work:
- 60% (120K) ‚Üí Warn PM: "Context at 60%, estimate X% more needed"
- 80% (160K) ‚Üí Start wrapping up
- 90% (180K) ‚Üí Urgent closure

### Quality Checklist

Before closing any issue:
- [ ] Code tested, all tests pass
- [ ] Docs updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Diff reviewed by PM
- [ ] Commit approved by PM

## Project Quick Facts

| What | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Project** | [PROJECT_NAME] |
| **Description** | [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] |
| **Tech Stack** | [TECH_STACK] |
| **Phase** | [CURRENT_PHASE] |
| **Workflow** | Human-led, AI-assisted, approval-based |

## When Stuck

1. Check project-specific AI guidelines (if exist)
2. Check project README and docs
3. **Ask PM** - don't assume or decide alone
4. Remember: You propose, human decides

## Integration Notes

**If this file was created by framework integration**:
- This provides general principles
- Project-specific guidelines take precedence on specifics (PR rules, deployment, etc.)
- Framework content was merged into existing guidelines, not replacing them
- Existing workflow and file structure preserved
